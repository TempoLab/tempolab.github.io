                <h2>Research Neuroplasticity</h2>
                <h3>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</h3>
                <p>I've mentioned somewhere, maybe in a reflection, that I am somewhat familiar with neuroplasticity already. I called it 'forging new neuropathways'. I believe this is what keeps people 'young' the same way daily stretching can keep ones body 'young'.</p>
                <p>The life learning aspect of being a developer is also part of what drew me to the tech industry, getting something like dementia is possibly my biggest fear and from my understanding devs have a much low dementia rate due to this.</p>
                <p>As for the benefits of understanding the principles of neuroplasticity I think it is a brilliant and empowering thing to know about oneself as your dreams are just a bit, or maybe a lot, of practice away. Within reason, I dont think I'm about to be an concert pianist any time soon, but I sure could learn to play the piano!</p>
                <h3>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.</h3>
                <p>I guess being more conciously aware of the benefits of repetition and the positive impact it is having on your brain can help in those moments of weakness when you feel like doing anything but what you should be doing.</p>
                <p>Also the mental practice and the value that has, potentially using idle time to mentally review things.</p>
                <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
                <p>Practice is the easy one, but recalling and actually using the information or things you have been learning. Basically telling your brain 'This is important, we need this'.</p>
                <h2>Research Growth Mindset</h2>
                <h3>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</h3>
                <p>Growth mindset is knowing that ones abilities are not fixed and can be developed, this is relevent when struggling with things and knowing one can get better.</p>
                <h3>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
                <p>Not entirely as this is a belief that I did already share however holding it in the front of ones mind is definately important as I have 100% not always translated this belief into actions. I wasnt aware of the 'not yet' instead of 'pass/fail', langauge is important and I'll definitely try to use language like this moving forward.</p>
                <h3>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>
                <p>As someone that is what I will call 'failure averse' üòÇ I will try to conciously be more open to 'looking like a silly goose' ü™ø. Its really not the end of the world and a quote I like which demonstates this well is.</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>The master has failed more times than the beginner has even tried. - Stephen McCranie</p>
                </blockquote>
                <h2>Blend with your learning plan and strategies</h2>
                <h3>Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.</h3>
                <p>I think a big takeaway from this is time spent learning or reinforcing information is time well spent, heck even time spent thinking about it. More directly related to code when struggling with a huge problem you arent only working on that problem. You are developing all of your other skills related to debugging. Then when you encounter a completely different problem you will use those same skills you honed on the last problem to solve this new problem.</p>
                <p>As for growth mindset I think things that could typically feel bad like failing, challenges that initially feel impossible, lack of results and at times feedback or suggestions. With the correct attitude or mindset can turn into positives. Failures are one step closer to success (and you likely learnt something too), challenges are the perfect place to learn, shifting ones focus from results to progress will help you focus on progress made instead of a lack of results and being receptive to constructive feedback will help you grow faster.</p>
