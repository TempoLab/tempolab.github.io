                <p>
                    Id like to kick off this post by saying I believe I'm pretty
                    confident in who I am. I've been in contact with old
                    childhood friends that have said I'm exactly the same.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Not in a bad way, more in a I'm still the optimistic
                    computer loving individual with childlike enthusiasm and a
                    perpetual smile they grew up with.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Values that are important to me would be transparency, good
                    communication and empathy. I think in both personal and
                    working relationships these things will reduce and even
                    eliminate frustration entirely leaving no room for mixed
                    messages or unrealistic expectations both ways.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I worked in childcare for 7 years and communication was
                    definitely key in helping days run smoothly, even highly
                    effective staff with good intentions could interrupt a
                    program when starting activities or games without
                    communicating their plans to senior staff members.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of childcare something I am very proud of is my time
                    spent in Aviation. Achieving my Private Pilot License and
                    passing my Commercial Pilot License exams and a hand full of
                    Air Transport Pilot License exams. Again communication and
                    being predictable is extremely important in aviation, along
                    with safety, honesty and attention to detail.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A large strength of mine would definitely be my passion and
                    energy. I am able fixate and fairly effortlessly work on
                    things that are important to me and in certain situations it
                    can be highly effective. I also believe I am fairly easy to
                    get along with and can play off of other peoples energy and
                    develop a genuine interest in their interests.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Conversely when I am not interested in something it is
                    extremely draining and takes a lot of effort and energy out
                    of me to focus and work on. Often resulting in
                    procrastination.
                </p>

                    An ethical situation I was in while working at a playground
                    while I was in childcare there was a dog that was locked in
                    the back of a hot van that was yelping. I had to track down
                    the owner of the car on the other side of the field and
                    speak to him about the dangers of leaving his dog (which I'm
                    sure he cares about) in the van. I am unsure if I would have
                    handled it differently, I am aware that you are legally
                    allowed to break car windows when animals are locked inside
                    however I am not really that sort of person.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is very rare that I encounter notable resistance or
                    tension working with others I generally confront these
                    things head on and try to talk them out. A scenario that
                    comes to mind was during one of my flying lessons the
                    instructors instruction devolved into what felt like a bit
                    of a bashing session. I calmly asked her if she would like
                    me to fly us back and end the lesson here. I believe this
                    may have brought to her attention what was happening and we
                    were able to continue the lesson without any further issues.
