                    What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and
                    your ego due to the core learning?
                </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The value of reflecting on scenarios through a more or
                        less neutral lense.
                    </li>
                    <li>Practicing mindfulness more regularly.</li>
                    <li>'Not yet'</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>
                    What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in
                    learning and programming?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    I believe a solid understanding of these things will help
                    when working with others as well as lead to better self
                    mastery which can help with things like feelings of frustration or
                    imposter syndrome.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Both the challenge and the rewarding nature of it. Its not
                    necessarily about getting everything right but it brings the
                    important things to the front of mind increasing ones self
                    awareness which allows you to improve on the areas that
                    matter to you.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    I think coming to the understanding that you can only
                    improve. Its not necessarily about being good at core skills
                    or not. Its about improving them.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so
                    much time focusing on core learning in a web development
                    Bootcamp course?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Personal health and wellbeing. Its easy to get inside your
                    own head when blocked. So learning to reprogram that critical
                    internal voice is valuable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Being able to work in a team without causing problems.
                    Learning to deliver and receive feedback in a positive and
                    productive way.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel
                    like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to
                    practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
                </h3>
                <p>
                    They do not feel like a waste of time. Even if I havent
                    managed to practice mindfulness, exercise and sleep as much
                    as I would have liked, along with a whole laundry list of
                    other things. The core skills emphasize the importance of
                    those things and as mentioned above they put them on ones
                    radar and as a result I am actively working at improving
                    these things.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the course only focused on programming I would
                    probably forget to eat or get fresh air, and end up a sleep
                    deprived husk by the end of everything as I would feel even
                    more obligated to put all of my time into coding.
