                <h3>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:</h3>
                <h4>were blocked on a simple problem.</h4>
                <p>
                    Last night I was working on a problem which involved adding
                    scores to a students information. I wasnt able to achieve
                    the outcome in what I felt was a reasonable amount of time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I had used a combination of a tool we can use to see whats
                    going on <code>console.log()</code> and google to reference
                    the tools I was using as well as look at some other peoples
                    examples.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After a bit of frustration and struggling I managed to pin
                    down that the breakdown was happening at the point where I
                    was trying to point to the student that I wanted to add the
                    information to. Turns out I was pointing incorrectly!
                </p>
                <p>What I had written down was:</p>
                <p>
                    <code>gradebook.student.testScores = scoreToAdd</code>
                </p>
                <p>and what I needed was:</p>
                <p>
                    <code>gradebook[student].testScores = scoreToAdd</code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    It took a long time for me to get there and I think I could
                    have avoided a lot of frustration if I just took a break to
                    refresh myself instead of having the mindset "I'll take a
                    break as soon as I finish this."
                </p>
                <h4>elegantly solved a problem.</h4>
                <p>
                    So... Also off the back of a silly mistake. I accidentally
                    misread the fizzbuzz challenge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fizzbuzz is a challenge where numbers that are divisible by
                    3 needs to be replaced with the word <strong>fizz</strong>,
                    numbers that are divisible by 5 needs to be replaced with
                    the word <strong>buzz</strong> and numbers that are
                    divisible by 15 need to be replaced by
                    <strong>fizzbuzz</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I had initially thought that the first part of the challenge
                    needed to take a list of numbers <em>not</em> individual
                    numbers. So although I managed to solve the problem fairly
                    quickly I was not passing the test we use. Luckily I was
                    fairly confident in the code I wrote and ended up chucking
                    the code into the browser console so I could log the results
                    to see why the test wasnt passing. (note: This was before I
                    worked out you could <code>console.log()</code> and run the
                    <code>xyz.js</code> file in the terminal with node.)
                </p>
                <img
                    class="blog-img"
                    src="../assets/img/fizzbuzz.png"
                    alt="Code in browser console."
                />
                <p>
                    When I saw the results where as expected I started to talk
                    to myself or 'rubberduck' and eventually, and I'm not sure
                    when or how, it dawned on me that I was only supposed to
                    check individual numbers and not a list of numbers. From
                    there I was easily able to change or 'refactor' my code to
                    pass both that test as well as the next test which was to
                    check lists, and that felt good.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think it goes without saying I would have saved myself a
                    lot of time had I just read the questions properly. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

                    Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these
                    problem-solving techniques/processes:
                </h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Pseudocode:</strong> I cant say that I use
                    pseudocode that much out side of challenges yet, I still
                    struggle a bit to break down my problems enough to justify
                    using it. I do use a notebook to list bigger things though,
                    for example when working on my blog I made a list of things
                    that needed to be done and checked them off as I completed
                    them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Trying something:</strong> Probably my most used
                    problem solving technique.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Rubber ducky method:</strong> I do use this method
                    from time to time but I only do it in its truest form when I
                    am <em><strong>stuck</strong></em> stuck. Otherwise I
                    generally will talk the flow of logic out to myself and see
                    if I can see something going wrong or use it in tandum with
                    <code>console.log()</code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Reading error messages:</strong> I think I am
                    alright with this though there definitely are some that will
                    throw me for a loop.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Console.logging:</strong> Through this most recent
                    challenge I definitly feel this one beginning to stick.
                    Before I would always forget or try bruite force and guess
                    what was going wrong or I would not know where to log to get
                    any useful informating. I am super happy that I am starting
                    to feel like I'm getting more value from this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Googling:</strong> Probably the second most used. I
                    dont offhand know syntax and I need to reference docs or
                    code examples a lot to make sure Im writing things
                    correctly. I also need google to reference the specific
                    tools I want to use to brush up on them eg.
                    <code>.map()</code> and <code>.filter()</code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Asking peers/coaches for help:</strong> Up untill
                    now I have managed to get by mostly on my own, I do have a
                    friend in the industry that I will sometimes send my code to
                    and ask how he would solve the problem to see what
                    tools/approach he would use. Sometimes we have a discussion
                    about the solution and then when I run into similar things I
                    will reference the tools he has brought my attention to as
                    mentioned in <strong>googling</strong> and try to use them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Improving your process with reflection:</strong> I
                    definitely do reflect on my code however I dont do this
                    conciously.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help.
                    Consider what made you reluctant to do so. What might you
                    try differently next time?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    At the moment I believe I am reluctant to ask for help as I
                    am working ahead of schedule so I dont need to worry so much
                    about missing deadlines.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I get blocked and things take a long time to solve I
                    have a decent amount of runway to attempt the problem on my
                    own. I believe also honing some of my problem solving skills
                    in the process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the future where deadlines are creeping up and I am
                    unable to solve the problem myself in a reasonable amount of
                    time I will definitely reach out for help but for now where
                    I have the time I dont feel it is as necessary.
