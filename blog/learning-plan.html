                <h2>Learning plan update:</h2>
                <p>
                    I dont believe a whole lot has changed from my original
                    learning plan.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
                <p>
                    My career pathway remains the same, ideally I would like a
                    remote job as a dev (although I am not picky). I did also
                    always intend to work on my own projects although I didnt
                    mention that in the inital blog post I dont think!
                </p>
                <br />
                <h3>
                    What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations
                    will be in Bootcamp?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    I believe my strengths and weaknesses are much the same as
                    mentioned in sprint 2. Although I havent had to struggle
                    much with motivation more the opposite sitting for 6 hours
                    without moving is wrecking my body. üòÖ As well as I havent
                    actually taken a full day off opting to spend most of my
                    weekends studying.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h3>
                    What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at
                    Bootcamp will be?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Non-technical challenges will likely start off being sleep
                    if I dont manage to get it under control by the start of
                    bootcamp. I have been keeping a relatively normal schedule
                    however I havent been giving myself enough time in the
                    mornings to comfortably start my day at 8:45am. Other than
                    that I will need to remind myself to get up, stretch, eat,
                    drink more water ect.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h3>
                    What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to
                    see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    I dont have a lot of experience coding with others as I only
                    have one friend that codes who is effectively more of a
                    mentor. So building experience coding with others as well as
                    building some self confidence as a developer would be two
                    human skills I would like to develop through the bootcamp.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
                <p>
                    I trust that the bootcamp team will provide me with adequate
                    guidence and support to help me grow as a developer over the
                    course of the bootcamp.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</h3>
                <p>
                    I expect to take full advantage of the oppotunity provided
                    by the bootcamp and the bootcamp team by putting in as much
                    effort as possible during the duration of the bootcamp to
                    see myself come out the other side a more confident and
                    capable developer <em>hopefully</em> ready to enter the
                    workforce.

                <hr />
                <h2>Learning plan v1:</h2>
                <br />
                <p>
                    My long term goal is to get a job as a junior developer,
                    preferably a remote job but I am not picky!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think my greatest strength when it comes to learning is
                    when something is interesting or enjoyable I find it very
                    easy and effortless to study. My limitations would be almost
                    the exact opposite if I do not find something interesting or
                    enjoyable I often will procrastinate and take every
                    opportunity to distract myself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I would like to learn to deal with and manage imposter
                    syndrome. As well as learning to accept and manage that
                    sometimes days where nothing happens aren't necessarily days
                    where no progress has happened it is quite hard to quantify
                    the value of time spent reading and learning to overcome a
                    technical hurdle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have been using toggl to track my time spent working so
                    far (it is a tool I that was suggested to me by a friend to
                    help 'quantify' the time I spend so as not to equate my
                    progress to lines of code).
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also use the pomodoro technique, although today I only
                    took the break on time once doing stints of, 35min, 2h 5min,
                    1h 21min and 1h 28min.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Moving forward into the bootcamp I would like to utilize
                    both toggl and the pomodoro technique aiming for 8h days
                    initially along with the recommended weekend day. I will
                    continue to assess my workload and gauge any extra time
                    required potentially putting in an additional study stint
                    after dinner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If I am struggling with a topic depending on how at risk I
                    am at falling behind I will reach out in the discord using
                    the appropriate channels to seek help.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From the Facilitation team I expect appropriate guidance and
                    aid to facilitate my growth as a developer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As for right now I do not have any scheduled commitments and
                    have notified everyone around me that Dev Academy is my
                    priority for the duration of the course.
