                <p>
                    My long term goal is to get a job as a junior developer,
                    preferably a remote job but I am not picky!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think my greatest strength when it comes to learning is
                    when something is interesting or enjoyable I find it very
                    easy and effortless to study. My limitations would be almost
                    the exact opposite if I do not find something interesting or
                    enjoyable I often will procrastinate and take every
                    opportunity to distract myself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I would like to learn to deal with and manage imposter
                    syndrome. As well as learning to accept and manage that
                    sometimes days where nothing happens aren't necessarily days
                    where no progress has happened it is quite hard to quantify
                    the value of time spent reading and learning to overcome a
                    technical hurdle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have been using toggl to track my time spent working so
                    far (it is a tool I that was suggested to me by a friend to
                    help 'quantify' the time I spend so as not to equate my
                    progress to lines of code).
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also use the pomodoro technique, although today I only
                    took the break on time once doing stints of, 35min, 2h 5min,
                    1h 21min and 1h 28min.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Moving forward into the bootcamp I would like to utilize
                    both toggl and the pomodoro technique aiming for 8h days
                    initially along with the recommended weekend day. I will
                    continue to assess my workload and gauge any extra time
                    required potentially putting in an additional study stint
                    after dinner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If I am struggling with a topic depending on how at risk I
                    am at falling behind I will reach out in the discord using
                    the appropriate channels to seek help.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From the Facilitation team I expect appropriate guidance and
                    aid to facilitate my growth as a developer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As for right now I do not have any scheduled commitments and
                    have notified everyone around me that Dev Academy is my
                    priority for the duration of the course.
