                    Knowing the difference between margin, border, and padding
                    is extremely important. Particularly when trying to lay
                    content on a page and understanding why things are, or more
                    likely, are not doing what you want them to do.
                </p>

                    I picked this topic as it regularly leads me to lots of
                    frustration. Even today when building this blog page!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lets start with margin! Margin is the space around an
                    element and is most commonly used for spacing! Margin will
                    also be consolidated, for example if you have bottom margin
                    10px and top margin 5px they will combine into 10px.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next is border. Border is a styled space that surrounds an
                    element, borders can be any range of colours and styles.
                    Solid, dotted, dashed, you name it! I sometimes use
                    temporary borders to help when placing things to give me a
                    better idea of whats going on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly is padding. Padding is the space inside an element.
                    When you increase padding you are increasing the size of the
                    element. Padding increases the click box of things like
                    links and will extend any background colour attached to an
                    element.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I hope you learnt something new! Or atleast that other
                    people struggle with margins, Borders, and Padding.
